# PocketSIEM Environment Configuration

# Backend API Configuration
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: For APK builds, DO NOT use localhost - it will NOT work!
# Get your computer's IP address:
#   Linux/Mac: hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'
#   Windows: ipconfig (look for IPv4 Address)

# DEVELOPMENT (Expo Go on same network):
# Replace with your computer's actual local IP address
# Example: http://10.64.243.196:8080/api/v1 or http://192.168.1.100:8080/api/v1
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://10.64.243.196:8080/api/v1

# PRODUCTION (Cloud deployed backend):
# EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-url.com/api/v1

# API Key - Must match the backend configuration
# Default backend key: your-custom-secret-key-here
# Change this in both frontend and backend for production
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your-custom-secret-key-here

# Request timeout in milliseconds
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_TIMEOUT=10000

# Notes:
# 1. For APK builds: MUST use computer's IP or deployed URL (localhost won't work)
# 2. For Expo Go testing: Replace localhost with your computer's IP address
# 3. Ensure your phone and computer are on the SAME WiFi network
# 4. Ensure the backend server is running before starting the app
# 5. For Android emulator, use 10.0.2.2 instead of localhost
# 6. For iOS simulator, localhost works fine
# 7. After changing this file, rebuild your APK for changes to take effect
